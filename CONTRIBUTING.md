How to contribute to Repo1
Did you find a bug?

    Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

    If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

    Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

    Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted (read more about our rationales behind this decision).
